# PDXMUD
This is an opensource project to recreate the West Coast Creations BBS game MajorMUD. MajorMUD was a text-based fantasy game owned by West Coast Creations in the 90's. It currently requires a Windows XP or older machine to run and quite a bit of installation. The goal with this project is to get the whole game re-created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript and get it into a playable form in a browser. It is not intended for re-sale, profit or anything of this nature. It is a project initially taken up in order to learn new aspects of JavaScript, MySQL and PHP. If you're interested, please get in touch.
